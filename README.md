## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm **Gustavo Tibolla Gallo**, a 19-year-old Computer Engineering student currently in my third semester at **PUCRS** (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul), based in **Porto Alegre, Brazil**.

I'm passionate about technology, programming, and hardware development. I enjoy learning by building projects that blend creativity with technical skills â€” from software to electronics.

Currently, I'm a member of **PET InformÃ¡tica** and I contribute to research projects at the **LSA (Autonomous Systems Laboratory)** at PUCRS, where I mainly work with **embedded systems**.
