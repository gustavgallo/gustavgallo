## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Gustavo Tibolla Gallo**, a 20-year-old Computer Engineering student currently in my 4º semester at **PUCRS** (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul), based in **Porto Alegre, Brazil**.

I'm passionate about technology, programming, and hardware development. I enjoy learning by building projects that blend creativity with technical skills — from software to electronics.

I'm currently a member of PUCRS's **[PET-Informática](https://petinfpucrs.github.io/)** and contribute to research projects at the **LSA — Autonomous Systems Laboratory**, where I mainly work with **Arduino**, **FPGA's** and **low-level programming** for embedded systems.
